\section{Present the iterations you made/will make to your concept.}

The feedback phase proved to be very helpful regarding our prototype testing. In 
total, the users were significantly positive for our prototype proposal. They 
found the concept of our  idea very innovative, useful and mainly helpful. Thus, 
the feedback that we got was basically confident. However, since there are 
always opportunities for enhancements, the users gave some comments that would 
improve further the design and appearance of our prototype. The majority of the 
users pointed out that, sometimes, it was quite tough focusing on key points, 
when the amount of pop-ups was large. Taking this into consideration, we decided 
to reexamine the design of our prototype. Refinishing our mock-ups, we 
concentrated on presenting our add-on in a more simplistic, attractive and less 
overwhelming manner. We narrowed down our options and we concluded to show the 
comments only when the user mouse is over the highlighted words. With this 
approach, the pop-ups appear only ``upon request'' and the user is not 
overwhelmed with multiple windows. The rest of the design of our prototype 
remains the same as previously.
