\section{Challenge Description}
\label{sec_a}

\subsection{What are the aspects of the challenge you already know a lot about?
What are your assumptions?}

\paragraph{Privacy}

Our aspect is not specialized  on application layer's  user's privacy,  
but we are focusing on privacy transparency on IP and Transport layers; 
specifically on  network traffic generated by the users, and  handled by the ISPs.
An Internet Service Provider logs and stores user's traffic that contains 
personal information. 
This kind of information might be used for further analysis by the ISPs or by 
third party entities such as Universities, Researchers, companies and Law enforcers.	
So, whoever is involved in this procedure should respect the user's privacy by 
applying data protection techniques, such as anonymization in those datasets.

\paragraph{Routing and storage}

Every Autonomous System has its own routing policies to forward traffic and these 
policies are mostly kept in private. ASes can have public and private peering 
agreements. These peering connections can be direct or can be through Internet 
Exchange Points. In the case of Internet Exchange Points, there are two main 
sources to extract information about peering on IXPs. The first source is the 
PeeringDB and the second one is the Packet Clearing House (PCH). 
These sources provide information about the members of each IXP and also provide
the peering policy of each AS. 

Moreover, a lot of research has been conducted to discover the AS topology map. 
CAIDA provides a variety of datasets about ASes and Internet topology. Also there 
are many well-known methodologies to discover topologies like ``DoubleTree'' algorithm 
\cite{caida}. 
These techniques can be used  to validate our results and also provide insighs 
on the routing policies.
Furthermore, big websites, like Facebook, use multiple servers in different locations 
to handle the user traffic. Content is served to users based on their location and 
also based on the load of each server in that time. So we know that our data is 
replicated in different sites (servers) and possible different countries. 

\paragraph{Surveillance}
It has been proven that NSA is doing surveillance in Internet traffic. There are
some applications and services developed to conduct this analysis on a daily 
basis at a huge amount of data. It is known that a large amount of internet 
servers are located in US and that is one major reason why internet traffic 
boomerangs through the US. Moreover, it's possible for NSA or other intelligence
agencies to access the data.

\paragraph{Ethics}
Ethically, the personal data should not be published. The extend of a user's 
wish to share private information should not interfere with another user's 
choice of data sharing.  For example, in some cases law enforcement has the 
ability to collect and use certain information when they are investigating 
crimes or prosecuting alleged wrongdoers. The military  should  be able to 
thwart attacks against us. In order to do that, government organizations might 
need to invade some people's privacy in order to uncover illegal acts. 

\paragraph{Law enforcement and regulations}
The use of legal powers of each government, in the context of today's far more 
complex electronic communications has proven to be highly controversial. 
All governments have incorporated national security exceptions into national 
legislation to give legal powers to agencies and authorities. Some governments 
have constrained those powers to limit the human rights impact; others have 
created much wider-ranging powers with substantially greater human rights 
impacts. Meanwhile, agencies and authorities have the scope to apply advanced 
analytics techniques to every aspect of an individual's communications, 
movements, interests and associations – to the extent that such activity is 
lawful – yielding a depth of real-time insights into private lives unimaginable 
two decades ago.

\paragraph{Economy and advertising}
\footnote{In this paragraph, we discuss user data from a higher level point of 
view.}

It is a fact that personal data are being used for advertising reasons. 
Personal data and information about the user's online behavior worth a lot for 
companies. The majority of online providers and sellers follow targeted 
marketing and advertisement techniques to boost their sales, drawing on 
important personal data. Trackers collect information about each individual 
customer. Thus, providers are empowered to extract valuable personalized results 
and form a marketing technique, targeted on each specific consumer.
In addition, it is also known that service providers use complex algorithms
in order to apply pricing policies to specific groups of consumers.
For instance, Amazon is a well-known provider that follows this merchandise 
approach \cite{chen2016empirical}. 

Ideally, personalization offers many advantages to the consumers, since it focus
on the consumers' interests. Still, the consumers do not have any control over 
their exposed data. To be more specific, one very interesting and crucial 
outcome of this personalization is price discrimination. Price discrimination is 
a microeconomic pricing strategy, where identical or largely similar goods or 
services are transacted at different prices by the same provider in different 
markets \footnote{Wikipedia's definition on price discrimination.}.
The data that trackers gather from the users are cross correlated to maximize 
the personalization. In fact, there are many works that address this subject. 
For example, Ghostery \cite{ghostery} is a browser extension that allows users
to block trackers. Also, AdBlock \cite{adblock}, another browser extension,  
helps users surfing without receiving annoying ads. Tor \cite{syverson2004tor} 
is another obfuscation technique that directs Internet traffic through a 
worldwide distributed network consisting of thousand relays to conceal users’ 
location from network monitoring and traffic analysis. 

Another controversial issue is the ownership of the user's personal data.
An example could be Facebook purchasing WhatsApp in 2014. 

\subsection{What are the aspects of the challenge you know nothing or little 
about?}

\paragraph{Surveillance locations}
From leaked documents and information we have found that NSA has at least six 
surveillance locations. It is certain that they will be more of them but there 
is little information. Governments and intelligence agencies are cooperating to 
ensure that this kind of information will remain secret and under the radar.

\paragraph{What happens with routing and storage of user data packets}
We don't know the peering matrices inside IXPs. Also, we can't detect all the 
IXPs due to limited knowledge of their IPv4/v6 prefixes.
Companies and ISPs don't inform the users about the physical locations of data 
storage facilities or what jurisdictions those facilities falls under.

\paragraph{Communications between ISPs and the countries}
ISPs tend to not publish their sharing policies of users data traffic.

\paragraph{User trust (from the aspect of user)}
It is assumed that users do not care about ISPs handling of their information.

\subsection{What are the difficulties that you think you will face in the 
process of working on finding out the information you don't know?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Surveillance info
\item Legal problems about finding certain informations
\item Leaks on personal info
\item Ground truth information and validation mechanisms
\end{enumerate}
