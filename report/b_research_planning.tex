inspiration from and which elements.}
\vspace{0.7cm}

\paragraph{Tails OS.\\}

Tails \footnote{\url{https://tails.boum.org/}} is a live  operating system that 
aims to preserve privacy and anonymity. 
It helps you to use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship almost 
anywhere you go and on any computer, leaving no trace unless you ask it to 
explicitly. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy 
online: all software is configured to connect to the Internet through Tor.
If an application tries to connect to the Internet directly, the connection is 
automatically blocked for security.

\paragraph{OpenVPN.\\}

OpenVPN \footnote{\url{https://openvpn.net/}} is an open-source software 
application that implements virtual private 
network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site 
connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.
VPN enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as 
if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. 
Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, 
security, and management of the private network.
VPNs are  also used to securely connect geographically separated offices of an 
organization, creating one cohesive network. Individual Internet users may 
secure their  wireless transactions with a VPN, to circumvent geo-restrictions 
and censorship, or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting 
personal identity and location. However, some Internet sites block access to 
known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.

\paragraph{Princeton Web Transparency \& Accountability Project\\}

Webtap research team \footnote{\url{https://webtap.princeton.edu}}, monitors 
websites and services to find out what user data 
companies collect, how they collect it, and what they do with it. With their 
measurement platform, they study privacy, security, and ethics of consumer data 
usage.

Webtap team has developed  OpenWPM, a generic platform for online tracking 
measurement. It provides the stability and instrumentation necessary to run many 
online privacy studies. It has already been used in several published studies 
from multiple institutions to detect and reverse engineer online tracking.
OpenWPM  is possible to detect and measure many of the known privacy violations 
reported by researchers so far: the use of stateful tracking mechanisms, browser 
fingerprinting, cookie synchronization, and more.

\subsection{Primary Research: In which context would you immerse in order to 
understand the design challenge better?}
\vspace{0.7cm}

The Open Observatory of Network Interference 
\footnote{\url{https://ooni.torproject.org}} is a free software project under 
the Tor Project which aims to detect internet censorship, traffic manipulation 
and signs of surveillance around the world through the collection and processing 
of network measurements. Immersing in those measurements helps us identify 
various number of transparency and privacy issues in the internet.  
A basic privacy issue is the blocking of websites  access for a group of users. 
The main reasons for blocking websites are user censorship and illegal 
activities. Reports generated by Ooni  on blocked websites clarify these facts. 
Also the detection of the systems responsible for censorship and surveillance 
has a big impact on users privacy.

The Tor network \footnote{\url{https://www.torproject.org}} is a group of 
volunteer-operated servers that allows people to 
improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this 
network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a 
direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share 
information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the 
same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users 
to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content.
Using Tor protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance known as 
``traffic analysis''. Traffic analysis can be used to infer who is talking to 
whom over a public network.
A basic problem for the privacy minded is that the recipient of your 
communications can see that you sent it by looking at headers. So can authorized 
intermediaries like Internet service providers, and sometimes unauthorized 
intermediaries as well.
Knowing this problem providing a usable anonymizing network on the Internet 
today is an ongoing challenge.

\subsection{Primary Research: The view of an expert: A talk with  Prof. 
Xenofontas Dimitropoulos.}
\vspace{0.7cm}

This part of the project aims to shed light on the aforementioned challenges 
from an expert's point of view. In order to acquire that feedback, our team 
proceeded to have an interview in the form of a talk with Prof. Xenofontas 
Dimitropoulos. A variety of topics were discussed containing the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Internet laws and their protection regarding the users.}
\item{ISP methods to store user's internet data and traffic.}
\item{ISPs' ease to intercept a user's traffic for analysis.}
\item{ISPs' interexchange of user's data.}
\item{Surveillance locations.}
\item{Similar research projects.} 
\item{Transparency and privacy concerning IXPs.}
\end{enumerate}

Beginning the conversation we talked about laws and regulation on the Internet. 
Regarding those, the professor mentioned he is not an expert, but he has some 
experience on the subject, mostly on issues regarding Greece. According to law, 
in order for police and government to have access on usersâ€™ internet data, a 
warrant is needed. Also, despite the laws that are established in order to 
prevent arbitrary use of private data, there is not a responsible authority to 
impose penalties.

What is more, ISPs play a major role in exploitation and handling of user data. 
In order to do so, they use and handle traffic mechanisms. There are many known 
mechanisms to manage user data, some of them more popular than others. Some 
examples of those are installing splitters and tapping the wires between the 
routers, which are the most common methods and also there are NetFlow and SFlow 
two mechanisms to record flows. The first two examples are used to capture and 
store the whole user traffic. However this results in a huge amount of data, 
which has both pros and cons. The pros is that by exploiting those data there 
are a lot of information to be acquired and the cons is that it requires a lot 
of storage space. Regarding the last two, NetFlow is a juniper router and SFlow 
is a sampling mechanism.

Furthermore, the professor used to collaborate with an ISP in the past. From his 
experience, he knew that the ISP used to store user data for ten years. The 
stored data were not public, but also did not use any anonymization techniques. 
The people working for that ISP had access to the stored data, but they were 
obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement, in order for the ISP to ensure some 
user privacy. However, even with those precautions, the absolute user privacy 
cannot be ensured, as there are ways to extract and publish information 
nonetheless. 

Moreover, ISPs are not in the advertisement business, meaning that the do not 
use data in order to construct user profiles for targeted advertisements. What 
ISPs actually do is that they inter-exchange data for security reasons. An 
example to get better understanding of that matter is that when an ISP is 
concerned about a user's activity to be malicious, it might forward the traffic 
to another ISP to inform it about those concerns. Also, ISPs have deployed 
systems that detect anomalies on the internet traffic. Those systems can detect 
malware and proceed to ban a user from the internet.

Regarding surveillance locations, there are not enough information revealing 
their locations, although some insight can be inferred from leaked documents. 
In those documents, some possible NSA surveillance locations were mentioned, 
residing in various US cities. One confirmed NSA surveillance point is located 
in Utah. Moreover, surveillance can also be accomplished underground and more 
specifically underwater. There are submarines and robots, built by the army, 
that act as surveilling mechanisms and are more difficult to be discovered and 
prevented.

Subsequently, we talked about the role of IXPs in the privacy of user data. IXPs 
are very convenient to facilitate tapping mechanisms. To do so, installation of 
hardware on the switch of the IXP in question is required, but such actions 
would be instantly recognised and prevented. Regarding the peering between IXPs, 
the existence of their AS peers is known, for a number of them. However, those 
peers are subject to change constantly, but it is assumed that a database might 
exist that keeps logs on those peers. There is a knowledge-based database, KDA, 
that contains some information regarding the previous matter. It would be very 
useful to be aware of AS peers, because it would help construct a more overall 
opinion on interconnections and research purposes. Regarding the last matter, 
Princeton University conducts further research and analysis.

Concerning transparency, there is a tor project, called \emph{oni}, which bans 
certain countries from using a variety of websites according to the laws of each 
government. In oni's mailing list, there can be found a list of blocked sites. 
As an example, in Greece, betting sites are banned due to legislation.

Concluding the conversation, we talked about user protection methods. The most 
commonly used is the use of VPN, either overlay VPN, which is a method provided 
by tor, but is also very slow, because it redirects user traffic through various 
nodes in many countries, or the VPN layer two. The second one is provided by 
ISPs, is more reliable and actually ensure faster network traffic. However, the 
professor mention that even as a more experienced user of the internet and 
despite being aware of the dangers lurking on it, he does not use any explicit 
methods for protecting his privacy, but he would be willing to spend money on an 
anonymization service, considering the provided services were verified to be 
trustworthy.

The basic purpose of our research is to better understand  the privacy and 
transparency on the Internet, from the point of  user.
The general section tries to identify the user by the basic demographics.
